Vicki is an extremely hardworking and dedicated teacher, who cares deeply for each of her students.  Not only is Vicki an exceptional teacher, but has another calling in her life of rescuing animals in our wonderful community. Following her many hours of teaching, she spends her extra time working for a non-profit organization in Cypress named, Lucky Mutt Rescue.  Vicki is the first person anyone on the Spillane staff calls if they are missing an animal and also the first person to reach out to if someone is trying to find a home for an animal.  She is quite simply the """"go to"""" person for any type of animal rescue emergency. 
     Last week, Vicki used her quick intuition, realizing something was very wrong at a neighbor''s house where she had assisted with a kitten rescue last year.  She noticed packages outside of the neighbor''s front door that would not typically have been left outside.  Something in her heart told her that this neighbor needed help.  Vicki took action and got another neighbor to do a welfare check with her.  Sadly, their neighbor had endured a stroke and needed prompt medical attention.  Despite the paramedics and physician''s care, Vicki''s neighbor passed away while she was in the hospital.  Vicki’s humble and giving heart would not want special attention for her acts of kindness, however, I believe she is the perfect example of who Elijah would want to recognize. Her selflessness and passion for life continue to inspire us all.  Vicki’s acts of kindness that she exhibits to her students, animals in need, and to anyone in need are what make her more than deserving of one of Elijah''s coins.
